# Model Artifacts Terms (MedGemma)

This repository may reference or interoperate with model artifacts derived from
`google/medgemma-1.5-4b-it` (including GGUF conversions and LoRA adapters).

Important:

1. Do not assume Apache-2.0 applies to model weights. The `LICENSE` file in this
   repository covers code only. Model artifacts remain subject to the upstream
   base model terms.
2. For MedGemma terms and usage restrictions, see the upstream model card:
   https://huggingface.co/google/medgemma-1.5-4b-it
3. Do not publish or commit any clinical note text (e.g. `EHR_test_data/`,
   `ehr_*.txt`) or other restricted dataset contents in any public repository.
